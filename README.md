# Volume-Control-Using-Hand-Gesture

In this project iam  going to use Gesture Control to change the volume of a computer. At first look into hand tracking and then opencv will use the hand landmarks to find gesture of our hand to change the volume. This project is module based which means i will be using a previously created hand module which makes the hand tracking very easy.
